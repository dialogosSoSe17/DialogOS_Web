Here you can find the current user documentation for DialogOS. Up to now (19.09.2017), it contains only information about some parts of the program that have changed during the transfer to Open Source. Please refer to the [original manual](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/courses/pd/dialogos/Handbuch.pdf) for further information. Remember, however, that the information provided there may be outdated.  
You are welcome to [extend](developerdocumentation#contribute) / complete the new user documentation on this website.
